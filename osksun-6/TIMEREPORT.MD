|2020-11-04| 10.5 | Added buildings and their components that are going to be used in the simulator. Also started with researching and implmenting unit testing for buildings and power plants.
|2020-11-05| 8 | Continued adding unit testing for power plants and user types. Researched on bicubical interpolation for wind speed based on geological data. Also added a library for gaussian distributions.
|2020-11-10| 9 | Added buildings and their components that are going to be used in the simulator. Also started with researching and implementing unit testing for buildings and power plants.
|2020-11-12| 6 | Started implementing interpolation to be used for having temperatures based on geological data.
|2020-11-13| 7 | Added bilinear interpolation that will be used for having similar temperatures and wind speeds based on geological data. Made a wrapper where our GeoData class can be used as input to the interpolation function and a test function for the bilinear interpolation. 
|2020-11-14| 5 | Created function for calculating consumption for buildings taking outside temperatures into consideration.
|2020-11-15| 5 | Updated the calculation of consumption for buildings and started making a GUI mockup for prosumers.
